Don't Repeat Yourself

lower technical debt by eliminating redundancies in process and logic whenever possible.
to improve the maintainability of code during all phases of its lifecycle.

Redundancies in process
principle seek to ensure that there is only one way to complete a particular process
Automating the steps wherever possible also reduces redundancy,
as well as the number of actions required to complete a task.

Redundancies in logic
principle use abstraction to minimize repetition.
